## 1. Implementation Phase
- [ ] 1.1 Create `src/core/zone.ts` with Zone interface
- [ ] 1.2 Create `src/core/world-map.ts` with WorldMap interface
- [ ] 1.3 Create `src/core/zone-connection.ts` with connection types
- [ ] 1.4 Implement zone management (create, delete, update)
- [ ] 1.5 Implement active zone selection
- [ ] 1.6 Implement zone visibility control
