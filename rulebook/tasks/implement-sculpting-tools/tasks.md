## 1. Implementation Phase
- [ ] 1.1 Create `src/sculpting/types.ts` with brush interfaces
- [ ] 1.2 Create `src/sculpting/brush.ts` with base brush class
- [ ] 1.3 Create `src/sculpting/brushes/raise.ts` with raise brush
- [ ] 1.4 Create `src/sculpting/brushes/lower.ts` with lower brush
- [ ] 1.5 Create `src/sculpting/brushes/smooth.ts` with smooth brush
- [ ] 1.6 Create `src/sculpting/brushes/flatten.ts` with flatten brush
- [ ] 1.7 Create `src/sculpting/brushes/sharpen.ts` with sharpen brush
- [ ] 1.8 Create `src/sculpting/brushes/noise.ts` with noise brush
- [ ] 1.9 Create `src/sculpting/brushes/erode.ts` with erosion brush
- [ ] 1.10 Create `src/sculpting/brushes/clone.ts` with clone brush
- [ ] 1.11 Create `src/sculpting/falloff.ts` with falloff curves
- [ ] 1.12 Create `src/sculpting/constraints.ts` with constraint system
- [ ] 1.13 Create `src/sculpting/stroke.ts` with stroke recording
- [ ] 1.14 Implement tablet pressure/tilt support

## 2. Testing Phase
- [ ] 2.1 Write unit tests for base brush class
- [ ] 2.2 Write unit tests for each brush type
- [ ] 2.3 Write unit tests for falloff calculations
- [ ] 2.4 Write unit tests for constraints
- [ ] 2.5 Write unit tests for stroke recording
- [ ] 2.6 Write integration tests for brush application
- [ ] 2.7 Verify test coverage ≥ 95%

## 3. Documentation Phase
- [ ] 3.1 Add JSDoc comments to all public interfaces and methods
- [ ] 3.2 Update `docs/SCULPTING_TOOLS.md` with API examples
- [ ] 3.3 Add keyboard shortcut reference
