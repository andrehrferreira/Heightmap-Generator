## 1. Implementation Phase
- [ ] 1.1 Create `src/algorithms/mst.ts` with Minimum Spanning Tree algorithm
- [ ] 1.2 Create `src/algorithms/astar.ts` with A* pathfinding implementation
- [ ] 1.3 Create `src/algorithms/douglas-peucker.ts` with line simplification
- [ ] 1.4 Create `src/phases/phase2-roads.ts` with road generation logic
- [ ] 1.5 Implement POI node system and placement
- [ ] 1.6 Implement road graph generation with MST
- [ ] 1.7 Implement A* pathfinding on grid with cost function
- [ ] 1.8 Implement ramp generation with height difference validation
- [ ] 1.9 Implement progressive slope calculation for ramps
