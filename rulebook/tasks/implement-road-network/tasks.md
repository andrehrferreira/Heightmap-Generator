## 1. Implementation Phase
- [x] 1.1 Create `src/algorithms/mst.ts` with Minimum Spanning Tree algorithm
- [x] 1.2 Create `src/algorithms/astar-grid.ts` with A* pathfinding implementation
- [x] 1.3 Create `src/algorithms/douglas-peucker.ts` with line simplification
- [ ] 1.4 Create `src/phases/phase2-roads.ts` with road generation logic
- [x] 1.5 Implement POI node system and placement
- [x] 1.6 Implement road graph generation with MST
- [x] 1.7 Implement A* pathfinding on grid with cost function
- [ ] 1.8 Implement ramp generation with height difference validation
- [ ] 1.9 Implement progressive slope calculation for ramps
- [ ] 1.10 Implement road simplification with Douglas-Peucker
- [ ] 1.11 Implement road width expansion (morphological dilation)

- [x] 2.3 Write unit tests for Douglas-Peucker simplification
- [x] 2.4 Write unit tests for POI system
- [ ] 2.5 Write unit tests for road graph generation
- [ ] 2.6 Write unit tests for ramp generation
- [x] 2.7 Write unit tests for height difference validation <!-- Already in level.test.ts -->
- [x] 2.8 Write unit tests for progressive slope calculation <!-- Already in slope.test.ts -->
- [ ] 2.9 Write integration tests for complete road network generation
- [ ] 2.10 Verify test coverage ≥ 95%

## 3. Documentation Phase
- [ ] 3.1 Add JSDoc comments to all public interfaces and methods
- [ ] 3.2 Update `docs/GENERATION_PIPELINE.md` if needed
- [ ] 3.3 Add code examples in documentation
