## 1. Implementation Phase
- [ ] 1.1 Create `src/persistence/project.ts` with ProjectFile interface and serialization
- [ ] 1.2 Create `src/persistence/storage.ts` with localStorage operations
- [ ] 1.3 Create `src/persistence/auto-save.ts` with auto-save logic
- [ ] 1.4 Implement project file serialization (all layers, zones, stamps, config)
- [ ] 1.5 Implement project file deserialization
- [ ] 1.6 Implement project file validation
- [ ] 1.7 Implement project file version migration
- [ ] 1.8 Implement save to JSON file
