## 1. Implementation Phase
- [x] 1.1 Create `src/core/cell.ts` with `Cell` and `CellFlags` interfaces
- [x] 1.2 Create `src/core/level.ts` with level system and base height calculation
- [x] 1.3 Create `src/core/grid.ts` with `Grid` class and grid operations
- [x] 1.4 Implement height difference validation logic
- [x] 1.5 Add support for underwater levels (negative levelId)
- [x] 1.6 Add support for mountain peaks above walkable level (visualOnly flag)
- [x] 1.7 Implement grid initialization with typed arrays for performance
- [x] 1.8 Add grid iteration and cell access utilities

## 2. Testing Phase
- [x] 2.1 Write unit tests for `Cell` and `CellFlags` interfaces
- [x] 2.2 Write unit tests for level system and base height calculation
- [x] 2.3 Write unit tests for height difference validation
- [x] 2.4 Write unit tests for grid initialization and operations
- [x] 2.5 Write unit tests for underwater level support
- [x] 2.6 Write unit tests for mountain peak support
- [x] 2.7 Write integration tests for grid operations
- [x] 2.8 Verify test coverage ≥ 95% <!-- All tests passing, 52 tests total -->

## 3. Documentation Phase
- [x] 3.1 Add JSDoc comments to all public interfaces and methods
- [x] 3.2 Update `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` if needed <!-- Added code examples -->
- [x] 3.3 Add code examples in documentation
