## 1. Implementation Phase
- [ ] 1.1 Create `src/core/boundary.ts` with boundary system
- [ ] 1.2 Create `src/core/blocking.ts` with blocking zones system
- [ ] 1.3 Implement edge boundary generation
- [ ] 1.4 Implement interior boundary generation
- [ ] 1.5 Implement ocean boundary generation
- [ ] 1.6 Implement custom boundary placement
- [ ] 1.7 Implement blocking zone placement
- [ ] 1.8 Implement blocking zone shapes (rectangle, circle, polygon)
- [ ] 1.9 Implement boundary validation
- [ ] 1.10 Integrate boundaries into Phase 4 export
- [ ] 1.11 Add boundary masks to export format
- [ ] 1.12 Add boundaries JSON export

## 2. Testing Phase
- [ ] 2.1 Write unit tests for boundary generation

- [ ] 2.3 Write unit tests for each boundary type
- [ ] 2.4 Write unit tests for boundary validation
- [ ] 2.5 Write integration tests for boundary export
- [ ] 2.6 Verify test coverage ≥ 95%

## 3. Documentation Phase
- [ ] 3.1 Add JSDoc comments to all public interfaces and methods
- [ ] 3.2 Update `docs/BOUNDARIES_AND_BLOCKING.md` if needed
- [ ] 3.3 Add code examples in documentation
