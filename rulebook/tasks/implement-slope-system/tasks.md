## 1. Implementation Phase
- [ ] 1.1 Create `src/core/slope.ts` with slope configuration interfaces
- [ ] 1.2 Implement progressive slope calculation function
- [ ] 1.3 Implement curve type calculations (linear, ease-in, ease-out, ease-in-out, exponential)
- [ ] 1.4 Implement angle to height factor conversion
- [ ] 1.5 Implement ramp height interpolation with progressive slope
- [ ] 1.6 Integrate slope system into Phase 2 (ramp generation)
- [ ] 1.7 Integrate slope system into Phase 3 (heightmap calculation)
- [ ] 1.8 Implement cliff detection and marking

## 2. Testing Phase
- [ ] 2.1 Write unit tests for progressive slope calculation
- [ ] 2.2 Write unit tests for each curve type
- [ ] 2.3 Write unit tests for angle to height factor conversion
- [ ] 2.4 Write unit tests for ramp height interpolation
- [ ] 2.5 Write unit tests for cliff detection
- [ ] 2.6 Write integration tests for slope system in road generation
- [ ] 2.7 Write integration tests for slope system in heightmap generation
- [ ] 2.8 Verify test coverage ≥ 95%

## 3. Documentation Phase
- [ ] 3.1 Add JSDoc comments to all public interfaces and methods
- [ ] 3.2 Update `docs/SLOPE_SYSTEM.md` if needed
- [ ] 3.3 Add code examples in documentation
