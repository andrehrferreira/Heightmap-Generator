## 1. Implementation Phase
- [ ] 1.1 Create `src/splines/types.ts` with spline interfaces
- [ ] 1.2 Create `src/splines/point.ts` with spline point class
- [ ] 1.3 Create `src/splines/bezier.ts` with cubic Bezier implementation
- [ ] 1.4 Create `src/splines/catmull-rom.ts` with Catmull-Rom implementation
- [ ] 1.5 Create `src/splines/spline.ts` with main spline class
- [ ] 1.6 Create `src/splines/operations.ts` with spline operations
- [ ] 1.7 Create `src/splines/profiles.ts` with width/height profiles
- [ ] 1.8 Create `src/splines/rasterizer.ts` with grid rasterization
- [ ] 1.9 Create `src/splines/cross-section.ts` with cross-section shapes
- [ ] 1.10 Create `src/splines/features/road.ts` with road spline type
