## 1. Implementation Phase
- [ ] 1.1 Create `src/core/navigation.ts` with navigation mask generation
- [ ] 1.2 Create `src/core/collision.ts` with collision map generation
- [ ] 1.3 Implement walkable mask generation (based on playable flag and slope)
- [ ] 1.4 Implement swimmable mask generation (based on water flag)
- [ ] 1.5 Implement flyable mask generation (3D areas)
- [ ] 1.6 Implement combined navigation mask
- [ ] 1.7 Implement collision map generation (blocking, trigger, overlap)
- [ ] 1.8 Implement water collision handling
- [ ] 1.9 Integrate navigation/collision into Phase 4 export
- [ ] 1.10 Add navigation/collision masks to export format

## 2. Testing Phase
- [ ] 2.1 Write unit tests for navigation mask generation
- [ ] 2.2 Write unit tests for collision map generation
- [ ] 2.3 Write unit tests for walkable mask
- [ ] 2.4 Write unit tests for swimmable mask
- [ ] 2.5 Write unit tests for flyable mask
- [ ] 2.6 Write unit tests for combined navigation mask
- [ ] 2.7 Write integration tests for navigation/collision export
- [ ] 2.8 Verify test coverage ≥ 95%

## 3. Documentation Phase
- [ ] 3.1 Add JSDoc comments to all public interfaces and methods
- [ ] 3.2 Update `docs/NAVIGATION_AND_COLLISION.md` if needed
- [ ] 3.3 Add code examples in documentation
